# Stock_Analysis
Write a program to help a local stock trading company
automate its systems. The company invests only in the stock market. At the
end of each trading day, the company would like to generate and post the
listing of its stocks so that investors can see how their holdings performed
that day. We assume that the company invests in, say, 10 different stocks.
The desired output is to produce two listings, one sorted by stock symbol
and another sorted by percent gain from highest to lowest.
